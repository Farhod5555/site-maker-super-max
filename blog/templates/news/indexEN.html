            <p>
              The consumer rights protection movement in the Republic of Uzbekistan In accordance with Article 30 of the Law “On Consumer Rights Protection” adopted by the Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan on April 26, 1996, in 1997, at the initiative of a number of like-minded people who decided to contribute to the protection of the population of Uzbekistan from low-quality products and services and combine their capabilities, the consumer rights protection social movement was established in the Shaykhantohur district of our capital in the form of the Consumer Rights Protection Society of Uzbekistan and was registered as the Republican Consumer Rights Protection Society in 1999. At that time, territorial societies were established in 7 regions of our republic. In 2000, at the Extraordinary II Congress of the Consumer Rights Protection Society of Uzbekistan, the society was renamed the Federation of Consumer Rights Protection Societies of Uzbekistan. At that time, societies were established in 9 regions and the city of Tashkent. Thanks to the efforts of active consumers, this public organization received special attention and support from the state. The adoption of Resolution No. 414 of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan "On Measures to Expand Public Participation in the Protection of Consumer Rights" of November 28, 2002 marked a new stage in the development of this social movement. At the same time, this resolution approved the organizational structure of consumer rights protection societies and the structure of the executive apparatus of the Federation of Consumer Rights Protection Societies. The III Constituent Conference of the Federation on January 17, 2003 united territorial associations in the Federation of the Republic of Karakalpakstan, the city of Tashkent, and 12 regions of the republic.
